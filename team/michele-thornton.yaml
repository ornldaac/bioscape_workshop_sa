  bio: I'm an ecologist and geospatial professional currently working at the Oak 
    Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC); part 
    of NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System and the ORNL 
    Biological and Environmental Systems Science Directorate. I really enjoy working 
    with the NASA and ORNL Science Community to both provide data that are useful 
    in their applications and to help with the long term curation of terrestrial 
    ecology datasets.  Developing data science tutorials and conducting webinars 
    and workshops also provides me with a way to be instructive to our user community.
