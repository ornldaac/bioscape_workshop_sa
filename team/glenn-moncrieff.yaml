  bio: My name is Glenn Moncrieff and I am a Geospatial Data Scientist and ML Engineer based 
    in Cape Town, South Africa. My background is in geography and ecology, and nowadays I 
    spend most of my time observing the earth with satellites and machine learning. 
    I train models and conduct research to analyse environmental data. Most of my effort 
    is focussed on addressing the biodiversity and climate crises. I am most comfortable 
    coding in Python and R.
