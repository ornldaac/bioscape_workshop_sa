# Compute Environment

These tutorials are written to run on the [BioSCape Science Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE)](https://cloud.bioscape.io/). More information about the SMCE is provided in this [user guide](https://bioscape-smce-user-guide.readthedocs.io/).

The tutorials use [Jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/) to run the scripts and print the results. JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. 

The Jupyter notebooks can be launched to the [BioSCape SMCE](https://cloud.bioscape.io//) using "launch buttons". The launch buttons can be accessed by clicking the rocket icon <i class="fa fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i> on the top-right corner of the Jupyter notebooks:
