about:
  description: This workshop will equip participants with the skills to find, subset, 
    and visualize the various BioSCape field and airborne (imaging spectroscopy and 
    full-waveform LiDAR) data sets as well as corresponding NASA Earthdata satellite datasets. 
    Participants will learn data skills through worked examples in terrestrial and aquatic 
    ecosystems, including wrangling LiDAR data, performing band math calculations, 
    calculating spectral diversity metrics, machine learning and image classification, 
    and mapping functional traits. The workshop format is a mix of expert talks and 
    interactive coding notebooks and will be run through the BioSCape cloud computing 
    environment.
